            <h3>Information Technology Student</h3>
            <p> My name is Ava Samantha Arce and I am an IT student with a passion for web development and entrepreneurship. I was born and raised in a small town in the Philippines, where I developed an early fascination with technology and its potential to transform our world. I found joy in creating beautiful and functional websites that could connect people and businesses across the globe. My passion for technology and entrepreneurship led me to pursue a degree in IT. I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives, and I believe that entrepreneurship is the best way to make a meaningful impact. <br>
                <br>Looking to the future, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. I am also interested in exploring other areas of technology, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, and applying them to create new and innovative products and services.</p>
